    <h1>About Me</h1>
    I grew up in Hamilton Ontario and lived there most of my life. 
    Met my husband and moved to North Bay area. Together we have battled ex's, 
    children, being homeless, buying our first house, kids growing up and moving out, 
    starting there own lives. many horible jobs and some great ones. his parents passing away
    mine disowning me.A reconnected sister passing very young and another sister reconnected. 
    
    Our next journey will be just as exciting with selling our house. We were tired of what seems like endless pointless extra bills 
    and what seems almost impossible to travel and enjoy our lives we decided to buy an RV- motorhome 
    and take to the travelling. I went back to school at almost 40 years old so I could potentially get remote 
    work and travel.
